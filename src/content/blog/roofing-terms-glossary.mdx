# Understanding Roofing Terminology: A Complete Glossary

Before discussing roofing projects with contractors, understanding key terminology can help you make informed decisions. This comprehensive glossary covers essential roofing terms every homeowner should know.

## Basic Roofing Components

### Shingles
The outer layer of roofing material, available in various materials:
- Asphalt (most common)
- Wood shakes
- Slate
- Metal panels

### Underlayment
A water-resistant barrier installed directly on the roof deck, beneath the shingles. Essential for preventing water damage.

### Roof Decking
The structural foundation (typically plywood or OSB) that supports your roofing materials.

### Flashing
Metal pieces installed at roof joints and penetrations to prevent water infiltration.

## Important Measurements

### Roof Pitch
The vertical rise of the roof for every 12 inches of horizontal run (e.g., 6:12 pitch).

### Square
A roofing measurement equal to 100 square feet - crucial for material calculations.

### Slope
The angle of your roof, directly affecting drainage and material choices.

## Structural Elements

### Eaves and Ridges
- Eaves: The lower edge of the roof that overhangs the walls
- Ridge: The highest point where two roof planes meet

### Valleys
The V-shaped intersection where two roof planes meet, channeling water downward.

### Dormers
Projecting structures from the roof containing windows, adding space and light.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Leaks
Usually caused by:
- Damaged flashing
- Worn shingles
- Poor installation
- Age-related deterioration

### Blistering
Bubble-like protrusions in shingles, often caused by:
- Trapped moisture
- Poor ventilation
- Manufacturing defects

### Granule Loss
The erosion of protective granules from asphalt shingles, indicating:
- Natural aging
- Excessive wear
- Potential replacement needs

## Professional Inspections

Regular roof inspections should check for:
- Structural integrity
- Material condition
- Proper drainage
- Ventilation efficiency
