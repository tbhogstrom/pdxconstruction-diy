# Attic Insulation Guide

Proper attic insulation is crucial for maintaining a comfortable living environment while reducing heating costs. This guide will help you properly insulate your attic for maximum energy efficiency.

## Planning Phase

1. Measure Attic Space
   - Calculate length, width, and height in feet
   - Multiply measurements for total cubic footage
   - Document measurements for material calculations

2. Choose Insulation Type
   - Fiberglass batts
   - Blown-in cellulose 
   - Spray foam
   - Compare R-values and costs

3. Calculate R-value Requirements
   - Check local climate zone requirements
   - Determine current insulation levels
   - Calculate target R-value based on heated floor area

4. Plan Ventilation Strategy
   - Assess current ventilation
   - Calculate required ventilation based on attic size
   - Plan for maintaining proper airflow

## Preparation

1. Safety Inspection
   - Check for roof leaks and water damage
   - Inspect electrical wiring condition
   - Ensure structural integrity
   - Test air quality

2. Air Sealing
   - Locate air leaks around:
     - Chimneys
     - Vents
     - Electrical outlets
   - Seal gaps with appropriate materials

3. Ventilation Setup
   - Install baffles at soffit vents
   - Ensure proper spacing
   - Mark ventilation paths
   - Verify airflow

4. Work Area Setup
   - Mark safe walking paths
   - Install temporary lighting
   - Place plywood walking boards
   - Set up safety equipment

## Installation Steps

### Preparation
1. Air Sealing
   - Seal floor joist gaps
   - Address penetrations
   - Check for bypasses
   - Verify completeness

2. Baffle Installation
   - Position at soffit vents
   - Secure firmly
   - Maintain proper spacing
   - Check alignment

3. Electrical Safety
   - Mark junction boxes
   - Secure loose wiring
   - Install wire protectors
   - Document locations

4. Depth Marking
   - Install depth rulers
   - Mark target height
   - Space indicators evenly
   - Verify visibility

### Installation
1. Vapor Barrier
   - Cover entire floor
   - Overlap seams
   - Seal edges
   - Check coverage

2. Insulation Application
   - Follow manufacturer guidelines
   - Maintain even depth
   - Avoid compression
   - Check coverage

3. Ventilation Maintenance
   - Keep airways clear
   - Verify baffle function
   - Check airflow
   - Document gaps

4. Quality Control
   - Measure depths
   - Check uniformity
   - Address low spots
   - Verify R-value

### Finishing
1. Protection
   - Install barriers
   - Secure edges
   - Mark walkways
   - Document layout

2. Final Inspection
   - Verify ventilation
   - Check coverage
   - Test airflow
   - Document work

3. Documentation
   - Record R-values
   - Take photos
   - Note specifications
   - File permits

4. Cleanup
   - Remove debris
   - Dispose properly
   - Clean work area
   - Final inspection
